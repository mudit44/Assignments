01. Read the data.
02. Segregate the na rows and store it in another variable.(V1 <- NA's are to be predicted)
03. From the left data pick 70% as train
#preprocess it
#seperate in num and cat
#seperate target variable
#standardize
#and load in model
04. And 30% as test
#tune the model
05. Predict for the V1(NA's)
06. Merge V1 with the data.
07. Apply logistic regression on the whole dataset.
08. Tune the model.
